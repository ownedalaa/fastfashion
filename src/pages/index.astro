    content: 'Fast fashion has revolutionized how we consume clothing, offering trendy styles at unprecedented low prices. This business model, pioneered by retailers like H&M, Zara, and SHEIN, relies on rapid production cycles that transform runway designs into store merchandise in as little as two weeks. While providing affordable fashion access to millions, this system has created a global phenomenon where clothing is increasingly treated as disposable, with the average garment now worn just seven times before being discarded.'

    content: 'The consequences of our clothing consumption extend far beyond our closets. Environmentally, the fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions and is the second-largest consumer of water worldwide, with a single cotton t-shirt requiring 3,000 liters to produce. In manufacturing countries, textile dyeing pollutes waterways with toxic chemicals, while mountains of discarded clothing overwhelm landfills in Chile and Ghana. Socially, the industry\'s pursuit of low costs comes at the expense of approximately 40 million garment workers worldwide, many earning as little as 33 cents per hour in unsafe conditions, as tragically highlighted by the 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse that killed over 1,100 people.'

    content: 'Fortunately, a growing movement toward sustainable fashion offers promising alternatives. The slow fashion approach emphasizes quality over quantity, with brands like Patagonia and Everlane providing transparency about their supply chains and production methods. Circular fashion solutions—including secondhand shopping, clothing rental services, and repair initiatives—extend the life of existing garments while reducing waste. As consumers, our choices matter; by investing in fewer, better-quality pieces, researching brand practices, and caring properly for our clothes, we can help transform an industry that has significant impacts on both people and the planet.'
